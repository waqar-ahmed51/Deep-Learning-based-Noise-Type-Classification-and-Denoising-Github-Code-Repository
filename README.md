# Deep Learning-based Noise Type Classification and Classification and Removal For Image Restoration

Welcome to the Deep Learning-based Noise Type Classification and Classification and Removal For Image Restoration GitHub repository! This repository contains the code and comprehensive documentation for the research paper titled "Deep Learning-based Noise Type Classification and Classification and Removal For Image Restoration" This work presents a novel two-stage denoising framework capable of classifying and effectively denoising images corrupted with four different types of noise. The proposed methodology achieves a remarkable classification accuracy of 98% and ensures high-quality image restoration, making it a versatile solution for various applications requiring image denoising without prior knowledge of the noise type.

## Abstract

## Key Features

1. **Two-Stage Denoising Approach**: The core of MultiDenoiseNet lies in its two-stage approach, combining noise type classification and denoising. Unlike single-stage approaches that suffer from reduced effectiveness, our method accurately classifies the noise type in an image before applying a noise-specific denoising filter. This allows for improved denoising performance on diverse types of noise artifacts.

2. **Classification of Four Noise Types**: MultiDenoiseNet's robust deep learning model is trained to classify images into four distinct noise categories. These include Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, chromatic aberration, and more. The classifier achieves an impressive accuracy of 98%, enabling precise identification of the noise present in input images.

3. **Effective Image Restoration**: Leveraging the accurate noise type classification, the denoising stage applies tailored filters and restoration techniques to effectively remove noise while preserving essential image details. The result is enhanced image quality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications across various industries.

4. **Flexible Application**: Our proposed framework is not limited to specific noise types, making it suitable for diverse real-world scenarios. Whether you are working with drone images, medical imaging, surveillance footage, or any other domain, MultiDenoiseNet offers reliable denoising without the need for prior knowledge of the noise type.

5. **Pre-trained Models and Dataset**: To facilitate easy adoption and experimentation, we provide pre-trained models for both noise type classification and image denoising. Additionally, we offer a carefully curated dataset, extensively annotated with diverse noise types, to support training and evaluation.

6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The repository includes detailed documentation guiding users through the setup, usage, and interpretation of results. Researchers, developers, and practitioners will find all the necessary information to reproduce and build upon our work effectively.
